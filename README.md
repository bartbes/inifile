# inifile
Inifile is a simple, complete ini parser for lua

version 1.1 
------------

-solves assert not closing stream gor write : this is a loophope of lambda functions imho 

-bring mpv config file hook compatibility   : handles special ini files with no sections

-docs (lazy partial fix from cached webarchive ) : Hey this is truly a random doc to see as http://docs.bartbes.com/inifile vanished!

NOTE: I switched to develop branch like Bartbes to stay in sync with original script.*Big thanks to Bartbes (Bart van Strien) the original author*
